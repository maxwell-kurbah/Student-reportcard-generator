    The Completed program is GUI based, using the tkinter library to create the GUI windows. The separately written module contains the different functions for calculating the average marks of five subjects and assigning the respective grade, to store a student’s record in the text file and to retrieve a student’s record by entering their name.
    The following elaborates on the storage and retrieval of data:
    Storage:  To store data into a text file, a function ‘store()’ is written which takes parameters being a student’s name and marks of five subjects. Within the function the ‘open()’ , ‘writelines()’,’write()’ and the self defined ‘grade()’, functions are used to write the name, marks and respective grade into a line of the text file as a single record of comma separated values 
    Retrieval:  To retrieve the data, a self defined function ‘retrieve()’ is written which takes the filename and student name and fetches the record of said student. Within the function, the ‘open()’ and ‘readlines()’ functions are used. The ‘readlines()’ function returns all the lines of records of students from which, we use a ‘regular expression’ and ‘list comprehension to split the comma separated string record into a proper indexed list.
